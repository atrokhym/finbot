        "To better incorporate the stop-loss and take-profit scenarios of a hypothetical trading strategy, we will modify the fixed-horizon labeling method so that it reflects which barrier has been touched first ‚Äî upper, lower, or horizon. Hence the name: the triple-barrier method.\n",
        "\n",
        "The labeling schema is defined as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "* y = 2 : top barrier is hit first\n",
        "* y = 1 : right barrier is hit first\n",

        "\n",
        "What about the side of the bet?\n",
        "\n",
        "The schema above works fine for long-only strategies, however things get more complicated when we allow for both long and short bets. If we are betting short, our profit/loss is inverted relative to the price action ‚Äî we profit if the price goes down and we lose when the price goes up.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to account for this, we can simply represent side as 2 for long and 0 for short. Thus we can multiply our returns by the side, so whenever we‚Äôre betting short the negative returns become positive and vice-versa. Effectively, we flip the y = 2 and y = 0 labels if side = 0.\n",
